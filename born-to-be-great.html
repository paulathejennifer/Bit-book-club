                    This name is a reflection of how, at the time, South African society forced children of two
                    different races to degrade their worth and think of themselves as nothing, even though they could grow up to
                    be impactful adults in the society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In "Born a Crime," Trevor Noah uses humour to highlight his painful upbringing as a
                    mixed-race child in South Africa during the apartheid era. The narrative, which is satirical
                    with a hint of humour, is essentially an eventful rollercoaster of his early experiences—both
                    positive and negative—during and after apartheid.
                    The primary focus of the book is Trevor's mother, Patricia Nambuyisola, and her
                    perseverance in raising Trevor despite numerous unfavourable situations. Trevor, who was
                    born to an African mother and a Swiss father, struggled because he was unable to identify
                    with a particular race and had to spend most of his time in the shadows because it was
                    against the law for a white person to have sex with a Black person.
                    Trevor emphasises themes of poverty, segregation, violence, religion, and race, all of which
                    highlight the difficulties of being Black, mixed-race, or coloured in South Africa during the
                    apartheid era.

                    He uses insightful life quotes from the various lessons he has learnt from his experiences to adorn
                    his book.
                    Among his well-known quotations was:
                    "It’s so easy from the outside to put the blame on the woman and say, 'You just need to leave.' It’s
                    not like my home was the only home where there was domestic abuse…. Where does a woman go in a
                    society where that is the norm? Where the police won’t help her? When her own family won’t help her?
                    Where does a woman go when she leaves one man who hits her and is just as likely to wind up with
                    another man who hits her, maybe even worse than the first? Where does a woman go when she’s single
                    with three kids and she lives in a society that makes her a pariah for being a manless woman? Where
                    she’s seen as a whore for doing that? Where does she go? What does she do?"
                    This was influenced by his mother being in an abusive marriage.

                    Trevor's storytelling style demonstrates acceptance of life as it is and the ability to grow without
                    giving up despite adversity.
