                                shared
                                language <br> says 'We are the same.' A language barrier says <br> 'We are different' "
                                <br> Trevor Noah
                            </p>

                    <p id="paragraph">When Trevor Noah was born in 1984, South Africa was still ruled by the laws of
                        Apartheid. Apartheid
                        was the South African government’s way of institutionalizing racism by segregating blacks and
                        whites. The segregation was meant to impose feelings of difference between the races, including
                        prohibiting interracial sexual relations. Being born to a black mother and a white Swiss-German
                        father violated these laws; consequently, Trevor Noah's existence was considered a crime. Due to
                        the
                        law, he had to be separated from his white father.


                    </p>
                    <p id="paragraph">This also put him in trouble, as he was not fully accepted by whites and did not
                        fully
                        belong to
                        blacks. He felt “too white to be black, and too black to be white.” He had to be hidden from the
                        authorities. Even though the government categorized Trevor Noah as “colored,” he didn’t fully
                        identify with that group either, leading to a feeling of belonging nowhere. There was even a
                        time
                        when his grandmother did not punish him because she feared punishing a child with a white
                        father.


                    </p>
                    <p id="paragraph">Trevor’s experience of racial liminality reflects identity struggles in different
                        areas of
                        multiculturalism. For example, in Ethiopia, there was a war that started in 2022 and continued
                        for
                        three years. At that time, citizens began to differentiate between each other based on race,
                        region,
                        and the language they spoke. There was no freedom to move from one region to another because of
                        race, and people were arrested for traveling to other regions.


                    </p>
                    <p id="paragraph">Trevor Noah also describes in his book that he felt like an outsider while
                        attending
                        Sandringham School,
                        which consisted of Indian, black, white, and Chinese students. The kids were grouped by color.
                        Trevor
                        Noah recounted that he was not welcomed by the colored students, as he was black. He could not
                        be a
                        Chinese or Indian kid. Most of his time was spent with black kids, but he could not be part of
                        that
                        group because they rode and walked home without him, leading to his exclusion. At the end of the
                        day, he
                        was all by himself.
                        Like Trevor Noah, I felt like a stranger when I changed schools during COVID-19. Students,
                        teachers,
                        and
                        administration were all new to me. I knew nobody, so I had to handle everything by myself.

                    </p>
                    <p id="paragraph">
                        Finally, Trevor finds a way to cope with the complexities of his mixed race. He learned multiple
                        languages to adapt to different cultures, creating the perception that he belonged to various
                        groups. He stated that language could be a powerful tool for understanding and acceptance.
