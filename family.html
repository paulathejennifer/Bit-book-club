                    <h1 id="family-text">Family</h1>
                    <p id="motivation"><i>"Being chosen is the greatest gift you can give to another human being."</i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="family-paragraph">Trevor's existence is illegal. He is "born a crime" because apartheid
                        laws
                        has banned a relationship between different races. Knowing this Trevor's mom, Patricia, chooses
                        to
                        prioritize family rooted in love and becomes a revolutionary in her own way.
                        Despite being judged and isolated, she raises Trevor alone with love, treating him not as a
                        crime but as a blessing. <br><br>
                        Patricia's love is unconditional and sacrificial. Her bond with trevor is unbreakable. They were
                        not
                        just a family, they were also team mates, which gives him a strong foundation of
                        confidence.<br><br> In
                        communities affected by war or displacement, like in parts of Africa, many mothers have had to
                        raise
                        their children alone due to the absence of fathers, just like Patricia did.
                        Despite limited resources, these women prioritize their children's education, safety, and moral
                        upbringing. <br><br> They become both mother and father, protector and provider, showing
                        resilence
                        much like Patricia. Their sacrifice and courage mirror the powerful theme in Born a Crime, that
                        family love and commitment can overcome even the hardest conditions.</p>

                <div class="protection-review">
                    <h1 id="protection-text">Protection</h1>
                    <p id="protection-quote"><i>"My mother said, ' If you don't fight for yourself, no one will fight
                            for you.'"</i></p>
                    <p class="protection-paragraph">Patricia goes to extreme length to protect Trevor physically and
                        emotionally. She teaches him how to hide in plain sight, and how to move between racial groups.
                        <br><br>Patricia hides him indoors so the police don't see he's mixed-race. She pretends he is
                        not
                        her child in public, she moves from place to place, changing jobs and churches, always thinking
                        how
                        best to shield him from a world that could punish him just for existing.
                        Even her strict parenting like punishing him when he misbehaves or demanding he read and speak
                        in
                        multiple languages is a form of protection.<br><br> Immigrant parents sometimes give up legal
                        names
                        or falsify documents to get their children into better schools or safer living
                        environments. Like Patricia, their goal is not for gain, but protection from harm.

                <div class="survival-review">
                    <h1 id="survival-text">Survival</h1>
                    <p id="survival-quote"><i>"In South Africa, you were breaking the law just by being born. We had to
                            be ccriminals to live."</i></p>
                    <p class="survival-paragraph">Survival was a daily mission for Trevor and his mother. From
                        navigating
                        apartheid's racist laws to escaping domestic abuse, they live by resilience. Trevor learns to
                        code-switch between languages and social groups to avoid conflict and gain acceptance. Patricia
                        survives with faith, determination, and by outsmarting systems built to hold her down.<br><br>
                        Their
                        survival wasn't just pysical. It was psychological and cultural. Trevor becomes a master of
                        identity, always analyzing, learning how to stay invisible when needed, and how to speak up when
                        safe.<br><br> Street children in big cities often survive by hustling, selling items, and
                        performing
                        tricks.<br> Like Trevor, they adapt quickly, find joy in hardship, and fight for a future even
                        when
                        the odds are stacked against them.</p>
