            <h3>Racism and Identity</h3>
            <p>
                In her book Becoming, Michelle Obama explained how racism and sexism have affected her
                family. Michelle’s grandfather, Dandy, who was born in 1912 in South Carolina, was deprived of
                going to college despite being excellent and intelligent, just because he was from a poor family
                and he was Black. He moved to Chicago to find a high-paying job, leaving racial oppression in
                South Carolina, but it was difficult to find a well-paying job without a union card (it was
                impossible for Black people). Michelle also notes that her great-aunt Robbie faced
                discrimination due to her race. Robbie sued Northwestern University for discrimination because
                she had registered for a workshop there but was not being allowed to have a room in the
                women’s dorm and was denied getting an education.<br>

                Michelle illustrated how racism continues to influence her family. For instance, when Michelle’s
                brother, Craig, received a new bike, he was immediately arrested by the police because they
                assumed a young Black boy could not own a bike. The discrimination was also evident when
                Michelle was admitted to Princeton University. People thought that she got it because of the
                affirmative action, which is wrong and devalues the hard-earned work she has done.
                The impact of racism and stereotypes becomes especially clear during Barack’s presidential
                campaign and election. Rumors spread that Barack was a radical Muslim, and during his second
                campaign and election, Barack faced challenges as there were conspiracy theories that Barack's
                Hawaiian birth certificate was fake. These criticisms are racist because they come from the fact
                that Barack is Black and has a name that sounds unfamiliar to many white people.
                Michelle herself also faces prejudice because she is Black. People criticized Michelle for her
                choice of dressing and her speech. But she was strong enough to fight back against such
                criticisms.<br><br>
            </p>

            <h3>Love and Relationships</h3>
            <p>
                Michelle Obama is a resilient and determined woman who believes in
                accountability and taking full responsibility for every aspect of her life.
                She is forced to balance responsibilities between her family, her husband's
                political life, and her role as the first lady of the United States. She
                acknowledges that it is not easy and requires making many compromises to
                maintain balance and sobriety.<br>

                <img id="wedding" src="trevor-noah-blog-Images/wedding.jpg">


                Michelle falls in love with Obama and, despite their differences, she handles
                their relationship in an ideally sophisticated manner. Michelle realises that
                Obama does not mind messes, whereas she is a neat-freak and prefers being
                orderly. When Obama leaves to go back to Harvard Law School, Michelle asks
                Obama to call him frequently to keep in touch, but Obama insists on writing,
                saying that he is “not much of a phone guy,”. She accepts, but makes sure
                that they hear each other’s voices at least once in a while. The long-distance
                relationship compromise is also seen where, after the wedding, Obama had a
                deadline to finish his book to pay off his debts. His mother rents a cabin for
                him for six months in Indonesia, causing Michelle to feel lonely for six months.
                <br>


                Michelle had had previous experiences in relationships having had her first
                boyfriend in Princeton, Kevin, a hunky football star who was a ‘near
                impossible combination of tall, sweet and rugged’. Their relationship ended
                after Kevin decided to pursue a career as an NFL mascot. She also talks
                about her first serious boyfriend, David, who smoked pot and held dates at
                Red Lobster. <br>

                Throughout all these relationships, Michelle taught herself how to embrace
                different personalities in people as well as to live adapting to various lifestyle.
                This ability to adapt to others would also help Michelle cope as a leader in various
                organizations.<br><br>


            <h3>Friendships</h3>

            <p>
                Michelle Obama writes, ” Friendships between women, as any woman will tell you, are built of a
                thousand small acts of kindness… swapped back and forth and over again,” and she also writes, “For
                me, maintaining close friendships isn’t an option—it is a necessity.” I often refer to my close
                friends as my “kitchen table.” The friends at my table come from all different parts of my life—
                college, Chicago, DC, and every other period, too.

                Having this perspective, Michelle and Jesse Jackson’s daughter, Santita Jackson, were very close
                buddies when they were young. Santita Jackson was eventually Michelle Obama’s maid of honor
                at her wedding. 

                Santita grew up with Jesse Jackson being her father, and once in a while, Michelle Obama would
                follow her to her father’s rallies. Michelle Obama recalls that at the time, she used to marvel at
                the idea of being the child of a political figure like Jesse Jackson.

                At college, Michelle got a close friend called Suzanne Alele. She and Suzanne are poles apart
                despite their close friendship: she often prioritizes fun over making a practical choices. Michelle
                judges her for this, but when she passes away from an aggressive cancer at twenty-six, Michelle
                realizes that Suzanne’s way of doing things may have been right, and Michelle tries to find more
                fulfilling work in her life.

                Michelle also met Valerie Jarrett in 1991, when she was deputy chief of staff at the Chicago
                mayor’s office. She quickly became a trusted friend and adviser to both Michelle and Barack.

                Overall, Michelle places a high value on friendship, which is why she has long-lasting friendships
                starting from her childhood.
            </p>

            <h3>Family</h3>
            <p>
                In Becoming, Michelle Obama beautifully illustrates her deep love and unwavering
                support for her family, especially her father. Despite his struggle with multiple sclerosis,
                their relationship remained strong, marked by deep respect, affection, and unspoken
                understanding. Michelle admired his quiet strength and dignity, and in return, she
                showed her love through care and attentiveness helping him with tasks, walking slowly
                beside him, and always making sure he felt included and respected. She never saw him
                as weak, but as a hero who inspired her to be strong, compassionate, and determined.
                Her actions reflected the deep bond they shared, and her close knit family, rooted in love
                and resilience, became the foundation of her strength and identity.<br><br>

                <img id="family" src="trevor-noah-blog-Images/family.jpg"><br>
            <figcaption><i>The Robinson Family - From left to right; Craig Robinson,<br>

                    somwhere around 1965</i></figcaption>
            <br>

            <p>Michelle describes her childhood home on the South Side of Chicago a small apartment
                where she, her brother Craig, and their parents lived close together, often hearing each
                other through the walls. Despite the modest space, it was filled with warmth, love, and
                strong values. Her parents, Fraser and Marian, worked hard to give their children a good
                life, teaching them to speak up, stay grounded, and believe in their worth. That tiny
                upstairs apartment, with its closeness and care, laid the foundation for Michelle's deep
                sense of family, resilience, and purpose. It’s a powerful reminder that love and strength
                often grow strongest in the humblest of homes. <br><br>

                Their relationship with their daughters, Malia and Sasha, was filled with intentional care,
                warmth, and presence, despite the demands of public life. The moment that reveals their
                priorities as parents was when Malia fell seriously ill as a baby. Michelle recalls how
                <img id="obama-family" src="trevor-noah-blog-Images/Obama_Family.jpg"><br>
            <figcaption><i>The Obama Family - The 44th family<br>
                    of the United States of America </i></figcaption>
            <br>

            <p>Barack, despite his busy schedule, dropped everything to be by their side at the hospital.
                That moment showed her that he wasn’t just ambitious and driven he was also a deeply
                committed father who put family first. Together, Michelle and Barack made sure their
                daughters felt grounded, loved, and supported, shielding them as much as possible from
                the pressures of fame while giving them a stable and nurturing home. <br><br>

                Michelle Obama beautifully expresses the importance of family through the deep bond
                shared across three generations. When Michelle and Barack had to travel or focus on
                demanding responsibilities, her mother, Marian Robinson, stepped in not just as a
                caregiver, but as a constant source of love, wisdom, and stability for Malia and Sasha.
                By moving into the White House with them, Marian ensured that the girls were
                surrounded by family, not just formality. She treated them with quiet strength and
                nurturing care, offering a sense of normal life in an extraordinary setting. Her presence
                reminded them and the world that no matter how high the stage, family remains the
                foundation. Through Marian's support, Michelle and Barack were able to lead, knowing
                their daughters were safe, loved, and deeply rooted in the values of home and kinship.

                2. &nbsp;Leadership as a Personal Journey:

            </p>

            <h3>Death And Loss</h3>
            <p>In her memoir, Michelle talks about the death and loss that plagued her family and the people she cared
                about, and how it affected them.

                Loss of family Members<br>
                Fraser Robinson III<br>
                Michelle’s father’s death is the most emotionally significant loss. He had multiple sclerosis and
                never let the illness define him. Michelle and her family slowly watched their father deteriorate,
                but never had the conversation about his illness until he neared his death.
                He was hospitalized in the end and died from a heart attack.
                Michelle and her family dealt with the grief of losing their dad by crying and sometimes laughing
                because that is what he would have wanted.<br><br>

                His death deepened her understanding of mortality and how little time they had.

                Suzzane Alele
                Suzanne was Michelle’s friend who died at the young age of 27 from cancer. Suzanne’s
                unexpected illness and sudden death rattled Michelle in profound ways.
                It catalyzed her realization that she hates being a lawyer and needs a career change. She
                re-examined her judgement of Suzanne, finally making peace with her carefree way of life and
                how fulfilled she had lived.<br>

                Loss of black lives due to gun violence<br>
                We see a lot of black people, young people, lose their lives to gun violence. These greatly tie to
                the theme of injustice in the black community.<br>

                Hadia Pendleton, a 15-year-old honor student in Chicago, was shot and killed in Chicago Park
                after being mistaken for a gang member.<br>

                Hadia is among the young people who were victims of gun violence in the USA during Obama’s
                time in office.<br>

                Michelle talks about the emotional labour of comforting grieving families while maintaining a
                public role.<br>
                These moments strengthen her resolve to uplift and empower the youth.<br>
            </p>

            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                The book becoming is a perfect represantation of what young black women in society feel about their
                lives
                and how they cope with societal expectations towards how they should act and
                what they should be. Michelle was defined as angry, fastidious and also Black. She never let this take
                away her
                zeal and desire to soar higher and with this kind of mentality she managed to push against whatever was
                expected of
                her. She quotes that for a Black person to get acknowledged she has to do twice as good
                to get half as far. The book Becoming is definitely a masterpiece and is a whole well of wisdom 
                from Michelle life experiences. The book is definitely worth the read and would definitely leave you feeling .
