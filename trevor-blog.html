            <h1>Illegally Alive</h1>
            <p>Describes the experience of being born into a society where your very existence is against the law and
                seen
                as a threat to the rules that uphold injustice. As Trevor Noah, the first moment of his life was forced
                to
                live in hiding, to be cautious, and to fight for his right to simply exist. He was considered "illegally
                alive" because, under South Africa's apartheid laws, relationships between black and white people were
                illegal, and children born from such uniions were not supposed to exist. His life was a crime not
                because of
                what he did , but because of who he was.</p>
            <p id="quote"><i>"Love should be about accepting and uplifting someone as they are, not reshaping them into
                    a version that
                    fits traditional norms and not silencing them. True love sets people free. It never cages them."</i>
            </p>
            <p>The quote from Born a Crime "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife...but he never
                fell
                in love with subservient women..'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a
                cage.'"powerfully reveals a disturbing truth about certain relationship dynamics, loving someone for
                their
                strength while secretly wanting to break that strength and controling them.<br><br>
                Abel is drawn to Patricia because of her independence, intelligence, and strong will. She defies the
                system,
                raises her son alone, and builds a life with her own hands, which was not expected and allowed in Abel's
                culture. This contradiction still happens in many relationships today. Society often praises strong and
                empowered woman, but in practice, some men feel threatened by that strength to control it. I have seen
                women
                who are confident and successful are admired at first, but later pressured to give up their careers and
                dreams to fit a more traditional role. Even celebrities like Michelle Obama have faced criticism for
                being
                too outspoken as a wife, showing how society still struggles with powerful woman. <br><br>
                This quote mentions the tension between gender roles and personal expectations. Abel wants a traditional
                wife, obedient, quiet and dependent, but he falls in love with a woman who is none of those things. His
                love
                becomes violent, not because Patricia changes, but because he can't control her. This reflects a wider
                issue
                where some relationships are built on power rather than partnership. Some men thinks women are naturally
                under men's power. For that they want to control and show them their power. They don't want them to use
                their brain, to communicate and share their ideas with anyone. They just want them to do house chores
                and
                raise their kids. </br>
