    <p id="title">I would give the title Trevor Noahâ€™s Journey of life for the Born in Crime book if I were the one who wrote it.
        Because the book is all about what Trevor Noah has struggled and how he managed to survive in the brutual system. Anyway, can I write such an incredible book?
        I do not have to answer the question, I will leave you to read the following Blog and decide.

    <h1 id="gender">Women in relationship and work</h1>
    
    <p id="content">Today, no profession is meant to be only for a man or a woman.
        A Girl can do any job, even though some<br> work is not advisable,
        as it can cause  damage to her physical body. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <img id="figure" src="womeninworkimages/image copy 6.png">
    <br><br>
    <p id="text">Women in the past were not allowed to work, possess any property, or learn.
        The only thing they<br> could do was get married and give birth. 

        This has damaged the psychology and health of women:
        it make<br> them think they cannot do anything other than raise children. 
         Such an attitude affected the family, country, and the world, because they have much to contribute and solve problems. 
       So I believe the whole community should be supportive and do whatever it takes for women to get an education and access to health service.  
        </p>
        
        <p id="relationship">Men are also part of the community, so they have to help encourage women. 
            But from my experience, most of them including Abel want a girl just to be in her home, and take care of the family.
             They do not have a desire for their girl to be independent:
             they do not choose a free, confident girl who has the potential to do all by herself. They want to get married to a 
             girl who can make time for her family. 
        </p>
        
        <p id="strength">I understand their wish, and I want to emphasize that, 
            an educated woman can handle every responsibility of work and family.
